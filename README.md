# RTM - Ready-To-Migrate

Ready-To-Migrate (RTM) is a groundbreaking software architecture convention that enables applications to be migrated seamlessly across frameworks, platforms, and programming languages with minimal effort, risk, and time investment.
Designed for both modern projects and legacy systems, RTM enforces strict organizational, coding, and architectural principles aimed at decoupling business logic from technological constraints.

RTM is not a framework, library, or plugin â€” it is a strategic mindset and set of best practices for future-proof software development.
## Key Principles

1. **Minimal external dependencies:** Prioritize native and standard libraries to maximize portability.

2. **Strict layer separation:** Clear enforcement of MVC (or hybrid MVC/Clean Architecture/MVVM) with fine-grained service, domain, and controller segregation.

3. **Migration-first mindset:** Treat every project as if a future migration were inevitable, ensuring readiness from day one.

4. **Internalized features:** Develop as many functionalities in-house as possible, avoiding framework-specific conveniences that increase vendor lock-in.

5. **Cross-framework design:** Architect solutions that can be easily adapted for both web, mobile, desktop, and embedded platforms.

## Why RTM?

1. ðŸ›¡ Secure your codebase from framework deprecations and tech shifts.

2. âš¡ Accelerate migration efforts from legacy to modern stacks (e.g., VB6 âž” C#, COBOL âž” C++, or Angular âž” React).

3. ðŸ›  Reduce technical debt and future-proof your software architecture.

4. ðŸ”„ Enhance cross-platform flexibility for experimental deployments and rapid prototyping.

5. ðŸ§  Empower software engineers with a strong, migration-resilient design philosophy.

## Example Use Cases

1. Modernizing banking systems from COBOL to C++ with minimal business disruption.

2. Developing mobile applications with architecture-agnostic logic for Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift).

3. Building SaaS platforms designed to be ported between Node.js, .NET, and Go environments.

4. Accelerating migration from deprecated frameworks without full rewrites.

## Who Should Use RTM?

1. Software engineers designing critical long-term systems.

2. Enterprise teams managing legacy modernization programs.

3. Startups aiming for long-term agility across technologies.

4. Research projects needing high portability across experimental frameworks.
